## Bio
I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in the Department of Statistics in University of Wisconsin, Madison. Before that I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and received my B.S. in Applied Math in the school of the gifted young ([SGY](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn)) at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)). I am recently working in Professor [Claudia Solis-Lemus](https://solislemuslab.github.io)'s Lab.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on the statistical inference on phylogenetic trees and networks. Also, I am interested in Bayesian inference and relative applications.
